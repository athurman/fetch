"description":{"$t":"\nWESTIE RESCUE SOUTHEAST is headquartered in Nashville, TN.
                We are open to foster applications from all over the southeastern United States.
                We have a great need for foster homes.  We do not have a facility and for this reason,
                our foster families are the most important link in our rescue chain.  WRSE will
                provide all vet services, any medication a dog may need, dog food, a dog crate if
                needed and monthly maintenance meds such as heart worm prevention and flea/tick.
                Some foster families offer to provide all or part of the above as a donation to WRSE.
                We are a non-profit organization and can provide you with the proper paperwork concerning
                tax deductible donations or costs you choose to incur.  Everything can be provided....
                all you add is lots of love and a safe stopping off point on the way to a Westies furever
                home!  There is always a foster coordinator available to answer questions or help with any
                problem that may arise. Won't you please consider this worthwhile effort to help a rescued
                Westie?  We need foster homes so that we never, ever have to refuse help to a Westie in need.
                If you are interested in learning more about fostering a rescued Westie for a few days or a
                few weeks, please e-mail us at westiefoster4WRSE@gmail.com. We promise you will love saving a
                Westie! Even though letting go at adoption time may be difficult, there is always
                another to save. Please join us in this worthwhile, heart warming work!  Thank you.\n"},

"description":{"$t":"Reva is a fun loving and silly boxer girl.  She is approximately 3 years of age.
                     Reva seems to be house trained and crate trained.  She does well on leash.  She has
                     met a few cats and has thus far not paid them any attention.    Reva is an alpha
                     female and requires a home where she can be the \"top\" dog or where she is the
                     only dog.   Her nub wags like crazy and she has an amazing boxer wiggle!  She
                     likes children, and does well with both male and female adults.        If you think
                     you might like to adopt Reva or one of our other dogs, YOU MUST FILL OUT AN ONLINE
                     APPLICATION at www.mtbr.org. It does not commit you to adopting.  Every dog adopted
                     out by MTBR must be an inside dog. There are no exceptions!      DISCLAIMER: Dogs
                     have been observed while in the rescue program, and appear to be of stable temperament.
                      However, it is not possible to test dogs under all circumstances, so caution should
                      be used in new environments, especially involving young children."},

                     foster Mom and Dad.  She gets along very well while playing with the other dogs in
                     the house. Anna Belle is a bit shy around strangers and will need some time and
                     patience while working on that. She is pad trained for inside and also goes outside
                     to potty in the grass, however she still needs some work on her house training. She
                     is spayed, up to date on vaccinations and heart worm negative. Anna Belle is ready for
                     her new home.  Her adoption fee is $350.00.  If you think she sounds like a wonderful
                     new family member, please contact us for an application. Anna Belle is being fostered
                     in the Birmingham area.  She would love for Santa to bring her a new family for

Contact the person at the bottom of the listing.  \n\n  \n\n Delia is a one-year old beautiful Boxer-pit rescue. She has a brindled coat and striking coloring that frequently attracts questions. Part cheetah, part horse, part alligator, she is an energetic cuddle-face who could play all day long, but will flop herself down next to you when you get tired of playing (since she never will) and place her giant head in your lap hopeful for some petting.\n\n Her favorite past-times include sprinting the perimeter of the dog park (she is one of the fastest dogs IÃ¢Â€Â™ve ever seen), steeling food off the counter and giving the most irresistible guilty dog faces afterwards, playing tug-of-war, finding you under covers, kissing your face and anywhere you recently put on lotion, and jumping into cars.\n\n She is house-broken and doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t chew. She is working on her leash manners, and will need training and consistency (which she hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t really had, sorry!). She gets very attached to her human and loves her humanÃ¢Â€Â™s friends, but can be protective and shows some fear when unsure. She jumps fences, including indoor gates, and would probably need a fence 4.5 feet tall or taller. She LOVES cats and loves other dogs, but can rub other dogs the wrong way, so if you have dogs we will need to do a meet and greet first.\n\n YOU are an experienced dog owner without small children. This little beast is one of the sweetest most lovable creatures I have known, but she is huge, strong, and doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t know her strength. She needs space, and loves to run.
